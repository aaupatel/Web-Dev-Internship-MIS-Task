1. Eliminate Render-Blocking Resources:
html:
<!-- Include your JavaScript at the end of the body tag to avoid render-blocking -->
<body>
   <!-- Resize and compress images appropriately -->
   <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.misindia.net/images/40yr.jpg" alt="Description" width="300" height="200">

   <!-- Implement lazy loading for images below the fold -->
   <img loading="lazy" src="below-fold-image.jpg" alt="Below Fold Image">

   <!-- Use responsive image attributes -->
   <img loading="lazy" srcset="your-image.jpg 1x, your-image@2x.jpg 2x" alt="Responsive Image">
   
   <!-- Defer non-essential JavaScript loading -->
   <script defer src="non-essential.js"></script>
</body>

// Set cache-control headers for static assets (JavaScript solution)
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const cssFile = document.createElement('link');
    cssFile.rel = 'stylesheet';
    cssFile.href = 'combined.min.css';
    document.head.appendChild(cssFile);
});
